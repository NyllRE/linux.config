# Opinionated Fedora Configuration

This repo is my very opinionated configuration for fedora systems, specifically [Nobara Linux](https://nobaraproject.org).

**This repo adds the following packages**
- Visual Studio Code
- [Warp Terminal](https://warp.dev)
- NodeJS, NPM
- Fish + Opinionated Configuration
- Neovim + Opinionated Configuration
- Starship + Opinionated Configuration

## Installation
first clone the repo then run the `fedora-initializer.sh` bash script:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/NyllRE/linux.config.git
cd linux.config
sudo bash ./fedora-initializer.sh
cd ..
sudo rm -r ./linux.config # This will remove this repository as it has served it's purpose
```

I have plans of writing the same script for other linux distributions but I'm currently mainly a fedora (Nobara) user so it will be a long time before I write ports. Pull Requests are very welcome.
